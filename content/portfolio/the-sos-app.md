An open source project we are building for ourselves. Goal of the project is:

1. To establish transparent communication between software development team
2. To keep the entire team motivated and focused on what we want to achieve
3. To ensure smooth progress so no-one is blocked by someone else on the team
   (very common in software dev teams)
4. To ensure highest quality of work
5. To gradually build a knowledge base, so team don't repeat their mistakes, and
   don't waste time re-researching same problems

The application is 100% conceptualized, designed and developed by our in-house
team. We are using React/Redux, with heavy use of React hooks for modular
composition. On top of React, we are using Next.JS to reap SEO benefits while
keeping productivity of React. Database is powered by Postgres SQL, which
together with Hasura provide GraphQL APIs. We custom built authentication
mechanism using TypeGraphql and TypeORM that works behind the scene. This
project takes a balanced approach with hybrid microservices and monolithic
architecture, and is truly a project we love to showcase.
