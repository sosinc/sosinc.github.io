Goal of the project is:
To establish transparent communication between software development team To keep the entire team motivated and focused on what we want to achieve To ensure smooth progress so no-one is blocked by someone else on the team (very common in software dev teams) To ensure highest quality of work To gradually build a knowledge base, so team don&amp;rsquo;t repeat their mistakes, and don&amp;rsquo;t waste time re-researching same problems The application is 100% conceptualized, designed and developed by our in-house team.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sosinc.io/archives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sosinc.io/archives/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
